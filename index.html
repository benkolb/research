<h2>Quantitative Easing in the Time of Low Inflation (draft; last update: May 2016)</h2>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a DSGE model to analyse asset purchase programmes or quantitative easing (QE) both in times of financial distress and when used to stimulate inflation in an economy. My analysis shows that the effectiveness of QE measures is overstated when financial asset markets, in which QE measures take place in practise, are not explicitly modelled. I compare the effectiveness of QE measures in combatting inflation to alternatives like forced bank re-capitalisations or simple government spending. I suggest how a term-structure channel could be modelled in order to compare two channels through which QE can affect inflation, as well as a way to estimate the model with mixed-frequency methods.</p>

<h2>Monetary policy communication shocks (with Robert Goodhead; last update: March 2016)</h2>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we argue that methods widely used to identify monetary policy shocks confound the impact of surprise changes in the policy rate with the impact of surprise announcements about future rates (“communication shocks”). Although a large literature has pointed to the increased importance of communication by the Federal Reserve about its envisioned future policy course, high-frequency VAR methods have so far not differentiated between impact surprises and news shocks. This paper offers a means to distinguish between the two effects, exploiting variation in the size of jumps in federal funds futures contracts across maturities. Using a monthly sample from 1994 to 2008, results indicate that it is mainly communication about future policy moves that affects production and inflation in the ways traditionally associated with monetary policy shocks. Communcation shocks explain a substantial share of variation in production and inflation, much more than conventional monetary policy impact shocks. They can also be more easily aligned with historical episodes of Fed hawkishness and dovishness.</p>

<h2>The Effects of Common Banking Regulation in a Monetary Union (last update: May 2015)</h2>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of introducing common banking regulation in a monetary union. I argue that under national regulation, there will be differences in the choice and enforcement of the appropriate bank capital requirements across countries. If national regulation is joint by a union-wide authority, these differences are likely to diminish. Estimating a two-country DSGE model for Spain and Germany, I fnd that shocks to the lending conditions explain about one fifth of German and two fifth of Spanish GDP growth volatility for the period 1998 to 2013. The estimation suggests that during that period, German banks were more leveraged than their Spanish peers, while Spanish frms were slightly more leveraged than their German counterparts. My model predicts that enforcing the same capital requirements across countries 1) would change considerably the transmission of financial and business cycles in the Euro area, 2) would reduce volatility in output and inflation in the Euro area and increase welfare and 3) might have reduced the negative effect of the Great Recession on the real economy.</p>
